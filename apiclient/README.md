# shareavideo
Share a video with your friends to watch together!


Built with NodeJS, this app uses FFMPEG to stream a recorded video as a livestream.  Sample app at [share.a.video](https://share.a.video), and a blogpost walking through the code at [api.video](https://api.video/blog/tutorials/sharing-a-video-sending-video-on-demand-via-livestream).

You'll need an API key in your .env file.  Your server will need FFMPEG installed.

Install the Node dependencies (npm install)

start the app (npm start)

The app will be running on localhost:3030
